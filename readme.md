Here you can find all of the custom code used to obtain the results for the study entitled **"Humans use learning progress in curiosity-drived exploration"**

Article preprint and raw data are available online at the OSF website.

## Description of the files
Statistical analyses and data visualizations were done in Python 3.6 and R 3.5.0. Python dependencies are listed in the "py_requirements.txt" file, and the required packages for R are given as plain text in the "R_packages.txt".

Scripts (both Python and R) that were used to produce the figures for the article are named accordingly, and their outputs are saved in the "figures" folder. These scripts use different preprocessed data files that are stored inside the "data" folder. A jupyter notebook containing Python code that fits the computational models described in the article can be found inside "python_scripts".
